LUIT-June-2025-Gold-Polly-Pixel-Learning

This project demonstrates a CI/CD pipeline that uses Amazon Polly and S3 to convert educational text into audio automatically. It supports both beta (preview) and production-ready voice outputs.


Setup Instructions

1. AWS Credentials & S3 Bucket
- Create an S3 bucket (e.g., 'my-polly-pixel')
- Add a folder prefix inside S3 named 'polly-audio/'
- Create a new IAM user with permissions to 'PutObject' and 'GetObject' on your S3 bucket
- Generate AWS access keys for that user

Save the following secrets in GitHub:
- 'AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'
- 'AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'
- 'AWS_REGION' (e.g., 'us-east-1')
- 'S3_BUCKET_NAME' (e.g., 'my-polly-pixel')


Modify Text Content
To change the spoken audio:

1. Open 'speech.txt'
2. Edit the text to anything you'd like Amazon Polly to convert to speech
3. Commit the changes and push to GitHub

Workflow Automation (CI/CD with GitHub Actions)

This project uses GitHub Actions to automatically convert text content (speech.txt) into audio using Amazon Polly, and upload the generated .mp3 files to an S3 bucket in different environments (beta and prod).

PR Preview (Beta Environment)

Workflow File: .github/workflows/on_pull_request.yml

Trigger: When a pull request targets the main branch.

Action:

- Synthesizes speech from speech.txt

- Uploads the audio as speech-beta.mp3 to: s3://my-polly-pixel/polly-audio/speech-beta.mp3

This allows reviewers to preview the content before it's merged to production.

Production Deployment (Prod Environment)

Workflow File: .github/workflows/on_merge.yml

Trigger: On push to the main branch (e.g., after merging a PR)

Action:

- Synthesizes speech from speech.txt

- Uploads the audio as speech-prod.mp3 to: s3://my-polly-pixel/polly-audio/speech-prod.mp3

This ensures the latest approved content is automatically pushed to production without any manual step.


Preview Audio (Beta)
- File: '.github/workflows/on_pull_request.yml'
- Trigger: On Pull Requests targeting 'main'
- Output: 'polly-audio/speech-beta.mp3'

Production Audio
- File: '.github/workflows/on_merge.yml'
- Trigger: On push to 'main' (e.g. after PR merge)
- Output: 'polly-audio/speech-prod.mp3'


Verifying the Results
Go to your AWS S3 console and check the contents of the 'polly-audio/' folder.

You should see:
: 'speech-beta.mp3' (after a PR)
: 'speech-prod.mp3' (after a merge to 'main')

Click the object name to download or stream the audio file.


Why Amazon Polly?
- Serverless + No ML training
- Realistic neural voices
- Easy integration using 'boto3'
- Fast synthesis for real-time automation

Why GitHub Actions?
- Automates preview and production audio flows
- Runs entirely in the GitHub developer workflow
- Secure, isolated environments with secrets handling
